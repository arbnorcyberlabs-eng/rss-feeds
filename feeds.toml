# Economy Media YouTube Channel
# NOTE: Feed me up, Scotty cannot aggregate existing RSS feeds
# YouTube already provides native RSS feeds, so we can't include it here
# The feed URL is: https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCc8q4B1bj-668LMHyNXnTxQ
# Users can add this URL directly to their RSS readers

# If you want to include YouTube, you would need to:
# 1. Use a different RSS aggregation tool that supports combining feeds
# 2. Manually add the YouTube RSS URL to your reader alongside the generated feeds
